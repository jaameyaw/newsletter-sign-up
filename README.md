## Overview

### The challenge

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript (DOM)

### What I learned

I learned how to use images as list bullets, which enhanced the visual appeal of my lists. I also gained an understanding of regular expressions, which proved invaluable for form validation. Additionally, I became familiar with the oninput event, allowing for real-time input handling.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  order: -1;
  /* The order property specifies the order of a flexible item relative to the rest of the flexible items inside the same container. */

  user-select: none;
  /* It prevents users from selecting text or elements */
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  oninput="checker()";
  // The oninput event occurs when an element gets input. The oninput event occurs when the value of an <input> or <textarea> or <select> element is changed.
}
```
### Continued development

I plan to delve deeper into the flex property and improve my skills in creating responsive designs. I will continue my frontend journey by working on more projects that incorporate JavaScript functionality.
